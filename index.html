So you have made it.
<br /><br />
There are literally a billion websites you could have visited, but today you've decided to come here.
<br /><br />
You might be wondering who you're actually visiting.
<br /><br />
So let's see. I could start talking about being twenty-something, spending most of my time trying to understand the universe and making a living telling computers what to do.
<br /><br />
But the other things I have to say might be more interesting.<br />Feel free to <a href="mailto:leonva&#110;velz&#101;n&#64;&#112;&#109;&#46;&#109;&#101;">say something back</a>.

To get a program bug free people decided to sink an entire proof system in <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">a programming language</a>. I decided to test how well such a proof system works for getting a web application bug free (spoiler: pretty well). Don't miss out on <a href="https://github.com/leon-vv/Sql">a subset of SQL</a> built up in a completely type safe manner.

In programming an expression like 'a + b' is evaluated in an <i>environment</i> which defines the values of the variables used in the expression. But what if you could manipulate the environments like any other data in your program? Like pass them around, change them or evaluate expressions inside them. I figured out that many of the most powerful programming constructs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#Macros">macros</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope_vs._dynamic_scope_2">lexical scoping</a> can be implemented using such <i>first class environments</i>.
